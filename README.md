# Awesome Adulting

- Drink water throughout the day. If plain water is too boring try sparkling.
  If you end up drinking lots of sparkling water consider getting a soda stream.
  Get a kit to hook up a regular 5 lb CO2 bottle.
  It's much cheaper and you need to replace it less often. 
- A spray bottle with just water and dish soap seems to work better to kill
  wasps than the poison spray that you can get at the store that specifically
  designed to kill wasps. Weird. And it's super satisfying to spray mosquitos
  while they are flying with a fine mist. They just go plop down to the ground
  upon contact.
- If some of your electricity is out but not all then you'd probably
  tripped a breaker. There's a panel that allows you reset the
  breaker. Turn it off then on again. If it trips again then there's
  something wrong. Start unplugging stuff from the circuit to isolate
  the problematic device. The problem could also be in the wires in
  the walls or the circuit breaker itself. This could be a dangerous
  situation.
- Different combinations of wires for electricity exist and are connected
  together on a common breaker. We call these "circuits" and if one outlet
  overwhelms the system the whole circuit goes down. We have seperate circuits
  to isolate problems. There's usally a maximum amount of electricity than
  can run through each circuit. Maybe 15 or 20 amps. If it's exceeded then
  the breaker trips.
- You can clean with vinegar and you can clean with bleach, but never ever
  mix the two because the result is chlorine gas which is leathal.

# Kitchen

- Don't buy the sponge + scouring pads combos that they sell at the grocery store.
  Instead buy separate packs of blue scouring pads on Amazon (you can get a 100 for
  under $20) and sponges that come flat. I like both of them smaller so I cut them
  both in half.
- Sponges start to stink after a week or two. They leave a horrible metalic smell
  on my hands. Apparently that's caused by a bacteria. Every few days I fill the
  sponge with water and microwave it for 90 seconds.
- Put dish soap in a cheap squeeze bottle (you can get them from restaurant supply stores)
- Restaurant supply stores exist. They sell high quality kitch stuff much cheaper than normal retail. Find one that allows the public to shop there (some require you own a business)
- Parchment paper is awesome. The sheets are even more convenient than the rolls. I
  keep around the 12"x16" sheets and the 6"x6" sheets. I use them all over the kitchen
  when I want to make cleanup easier. I put them on the cutting board when cutting stuff,
  I put them over cookie sheets when baking.
- You can make parchment paper take another shape by putting it under warm water and
  crumple it into a wad and then open it back up. It will take the shape of containers
  better that way.

# Awesome Adulting

* Drink water throughout the day. If plain water is too boring try sparkling.
  If you end up drinking lots of sparkling water consider getting a soda stream.
  Get a kit to hook up a regular 5 lb CO2 bottle.
  It's much cheaper and you need to replace it less often. 
* A spray bottle with just water and dish soap seems to work better to kill
  wasps than the poison spray that you can get at the store that specifically
  designed to kill wasps. Weird. And it's super satisfying to spray mosquitos
  while they are flying with a fine mist. They just go plop down to the ground
  upon contact.

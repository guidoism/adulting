# Motivation

We describe — from first principles — what minimum skills and knowledge an adult 
needs at the bare minimum to not fail in modern society circa 2025.

# First-principles frame (Maslow × 2025)
- Physiological & economic → reliably earn income; run a home; feed/cloth oneself.
- Safety & legal → avoid legal/financial harm; practice cyber hygiene; know worker rights.
- Belonging & relationships → form healthy ties; work well with others; resolve conflict.
- Esteem & agency → advocate, negotiate, persuade; set goals and follow through.
- Cognitive & civic → reason with evidence; detect propaganda; participate in democracy.
- Self-actualization → learn new skills on demand; update beliefs with new evidence.

# Universal Capabilities (the “Minimum Viable Adult”)

## 1. Income & Household Ops
 - Outcome: Live within means; plan cash-flow; comparison-shop; cook, launder, maintain a room.
 - Minimum proficiency: Build a 12-month budget with buffer; file a simple tax return; plan & shop 7 nutritious dinners under a cost target; maintain a weekly “life ops” checklist.
 - Evidence: Budget+cashflow sheet; filed-tax simulation; 7-meal plan with receipts; weekly ops log.

## 2. Quantitative Decision-Making (Spreadsheet-first)
 - Outcome: Make choices with numbers, not vibes.
 - Minimum proficiency: Use a spreadsheet to model options (e.g., commute vs rent tradeoff); compute total cost of ownership; use basic stats (mean/median, uncertainty), break-even, and a simple decision tree.
 - Evidence: One-page decision memo with a linked model and sensitivity analysis.

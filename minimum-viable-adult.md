# Motivation

We describe — from first principles — what minimum skills and knowledge an adult 
needs at the bare minimum to not fail in modern society circa 2025.

# First-principles frame (Maslow × 2025)
- Physiological & economic → reliably earn income; run a home; feed/cloth oneself.
- Safety & legal → avoid legal/financial harm; practice cyber hygiene; know worker rights.
- Belonging & relationships → form healthy ties; work well with others; resolve conflict.
- Esteem & agency → advocate, negotiate, persuade; set goals and follow through.
- Cognitive & civic → reason with evidence; detect propaganda; participate in democracy.
- Self-actualization → learn new skills on demand; update beliefs with new evidence.

# What to de-emphasize from traditional schooling
- Excess algebraic manipulation drills for non-technical paths (keep mathematical thinking; shift time to spreadsheets, statistics, and modeling).
- Five-paragraph essay as the dominant form (replace with memos, briefs, proposals, and technical notes).
- Decontextualized lab “cookbooks” without decisions or tradeoffs (replace with real-world experiments tied to choices).
- “Digital citizenship posters” without operational security habits (replace with practiced checklists and drills).
- Clerical software routines (replace with automation mindset and data handling).
